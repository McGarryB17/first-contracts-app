        <p> Oregon Iron Works, Inc., of Clackamas, Oregon was one of two companies previously awarded indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract H92222-11-D-0080 in September 2011 in support of the Combatant Craft Medium Mark One (CCM Mk1). The CCM Mk I Program is an acquisition program to develop, test, produce, field, and sustain a modern, clandestine, agile, adaptive, technically relevant, reliable, and operationally capable combatant craft system in support of U.S. Special Operations Command. The government has tested and evaluated the test articles provided by the two Phase II CCM Mk 1 awardees during Phase III of this evaluation, evaluated final proposal revisions and has made a final down select decision awarded to Oregon Iron Works, Inc. The total IDIQ contract ceiling, previously announced, remains $400,000,000, and the period of performance inclusive of all options and ordering periods is through December 2021. Funds in the amount of $17,500,290 will be obligated at this time for test article refurbishment as well as support the purchase of long lead items and low rate initial production units. The majority of the work will be performed in Clackamas, Oregon. This contract was originally solicited through the Web as a 100 percent set aside for small business in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 19.502-2 with six proposals received. U.S. Special Operations Command, Tampa, Fla., is the contracting activity.</p>
