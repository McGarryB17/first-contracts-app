        <p> Alion Science and Technology Corp., McLean, Va., has been awarded a $12,851,147 modification (P00116) on an existing cost-plus-award-fee and cost-reimbursable contract (FA7014-07-C-0009) value estimated at $970,000,000 for technical and analytical support. This contract provides the following acquisition support services: programmatic analyses; policy analyses; budget analyses; administrative technical support; facilities engineering services; business reengineering analyses; database development; internet/intranet development; software application development; legislative analyses; engineering/technical consulting support; and acquisition consulting services.

This modification rebaselines the current program for the last option period four (Jan. 1 2013 through July 31, 2015) and reinstitutes the original, intended period of performance to Jan. 1, 2001 through Dec. 31, 2015, increasing the estimate. Option period four was exercised and announced in 2012; however, due to the period of performance extension as a result of the rebaselining effort, this announcement is reporting new work. Work will be performed at Arlington, Va., and Washington, D.C., and is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 2015. The following fund types will be incrementally funded onto this contract: Air Force research and development, procurement, operations and maintenance and foreign military sales to Israel, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Spain.
